Inspired by grid collages and my personal feelings of being confused about everything at 20; I made a collage of those feelings. Putting together things I've held dear to myself; music, my headphones, floral patterns. It's an all-encompassing collage of not only me at 20 but aspects of me at all stages of my life."

          description="This project began as a conversation with a friend about how to make voting more appealing to younger audiences. Inspired by the clean, elegant aesthetic of clothing campaigns from brands like ZARA and H&M, the initial concept was to create a minimalist and sophisticated series urging people to vote. However, the idea evolved into a whimsical and playful approach, designed to resonate with a broader audience. By focusing on fun and lighthearted visuals, the photos use selective coloring to highlight the I Voted stickers. This intentional design choice draws the audience’s attention to the sticker, subtly encouraging civic engagement while keeping the tone approachable and memorable."

This experience allowed me to explore new places like New Mexico and revisit new favorites like Chicago, that now hold bittersweet memories, of love I want to rekindle in the future and pain I hope to never feel again. Through these photos, I commemorated a unique adventure that blended discovery and nostalgia, documenting the beauty of the landscapes and cities that shaped my trip."
